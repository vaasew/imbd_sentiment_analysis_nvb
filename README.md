# IMDB Review Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes Algorithm

This GitHub repository contains code to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. 
The goal is to predict whether a movie review has a positive or negative sentiment.

The algorithm used to perform the sentiment analysis is the Naive Bayes algorithm. 
Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic algorithm that makes predictions based on the probability of a given feature (in this case, a word) 
occurring in each class (positive or negative). Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes has been shown to perform well in many text classification tasks,
including sentiment analysis.
Getting Started

To get started with this project, you should first clone this repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/vaasew/imdb-sentiment-analysis.git

Once you have cloned the repository, you should download the IMDB movie review dataset. You can download the dataset from this link - 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews 
The dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews, with 25,000 reviews labeled as positive and 25,000 reviews labeled as negative.

After downloading the dataset, you should extract the files and place them in a directory called data in the root of the repository.

# Result and Accuracy

After running the sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset, we achieved a maximum for Bernoulli NB at an accuracy of 84.1% on the test set.
